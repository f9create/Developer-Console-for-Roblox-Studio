--HOW TO USE THE COMMAND CONSOLE?

1 ID VERIFICATION IN SCRIPT

Change all cells with the numbers inside the brackets to your Roblox ID (123456). Without your ID, the console won't open or will return an error about insufficient rights.

local ALLOWED_USERS = { [1] = {name = "Dev", level = 3}, --Enter your ROBLOX ID [2] = {name = "Admin", level = 2}, --Enter your ROBLOX ID [3] = {name = "Moderator", level = 1} -- }

The three lines represent different levels of moderator/developer rights.

"Level 3" - unlimited rights (developer) "Level 2" - ideal for a moderator, with limited functionality. "Level 1" - very limited functionality

2 HOW TO USE?

It's very simple: go to File Explorer, open StarterGui, and simply add the local script with this .txt source file.

Modules are an important part of the console. They need to be added to ReplicatedStorage. Create a "ConsoleModules" folder there, then create "DEV" and "TEST" folders inside for test modules. Copy and paste the module code later, and you're done!
